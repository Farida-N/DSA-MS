## üìà Milestone 1 Grading Criteria

| **Criteria**                     | **Level 3**                                          | **Level 2**                                             | **Level 1**                                              | **Level 0**                            |
| -------------------------------- | ---------------------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------- | -------------------------------------------------------- | -------------------------------------- |
| **Problem Identification** (60%) | Detailed and clear problem identification with depth | Identifies key issues, but lacks full detail or clarity | Minimal problem identification; very limited explanation | No problem identification              |
| **Prototype Completeness** (40%) | Generates **all 5** `new_*.csv` files correctly      | Generates **4 of 5** files with correct headers/columns | Generates **2 or 3** of the 5 required files             | No prototype or unchanged base project |

**Submission**
______________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________
Push your prototype project.py (and any other files) into your repo. This will trigger an action
To see what you will get for Prototype Completeness part of the grade , expand the action and look at the test runner, it will show you what level your solution is sitting at.
Note that both MS1 and MS2 testers use the same runner but tested differently. Please make sure to read the correct line for rubric score for MS1
Submit a link for your group into ms1 submission. The most recent run, submitted before MS1 due date will be used to determine grade. If you are worried, you can delete older runs.
